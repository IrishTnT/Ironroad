### Ironroad, now on web!

Ironroad is a personal project to further my Python experience by processing the [IrishRail API](http://api.irishrail.ie/realtime/).
Ironroad is available under the GNU General Public License V3

Ironroad, originally a CLI application, is now available on the web! The web version is available [here](https://rail.irishtnt.com/).
