# Ironroad
### A Python Irish Rail assistant

Ironroad is a personal project to further my Python experience by processing the [IrishRail API](http://api.irishrail.ie/realtime/).

## Setup
### Required
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Dependencies
Install required packages through [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Credits
Endless thanks to [Saetom](https://www.saetom.xyz/) for the API parsing, the project would've been canned if you didn't save it!

### To-Do List
- Query Trains (0.2.4)
- Query Out-of-Service lifts (I've e-mailed Irish Rail about adding this to the API)
- Google Maps Integration to show trains, routes, stations, etc. (0.3)
- Calculate average delay on (0.3)
  - Route
  - all routes
- Discord bot (0.3)
- Add platform information (Needs Tensorflow and more data, 0.4)
- Route planner (Incl. transfers) (0.4)
- Bus-Replacement Alerts (Needs more data, 0.4)
- Rail Line maintenance alerts (Needs more data, 0.4)
