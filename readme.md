# Ironroad
### A python Irish Rail assistant

Ironroad is a personal project to further my Python experience by processing the [IrishRail API](http://api.irishrail.ie/realtime/).

## Setup
### Required
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Dependencies
`pip install requests`

### Credits
Endless thanks to [Saetom](https://www.saetom.xyz/) for the API parsing, the project would've been canned if you didn't save it!
